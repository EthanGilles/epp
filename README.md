## Project Description

The **Please Compiler** is a compiler for a new programming language, E++, which emphasizes politeness. This project was developed for the COS360: Programming Languages class, 
where the task was an open ended project, somehow related to programming languages. In E++, politeness is mandatory, and the compiler enforces it by requiring the programmer 
to include polite language throughout the codeâ€”most importantly, the word "please".

The idea behind the project is to encourage a unique syntax style that introduces humor and creativity into programming while exploring the process of language design and compiler construction.

## Features

- **Syntax Enforcement**: The compiler will only compile code if it detects the right amount of polite language, including "please" or "PLEASE".
- **Basic Language Constructs**: Supports fundamental operations, including variable declarations, basic arithmetic, conditional statements and print statements.
- **Error Handling**: Provides 'user-friendly' error messages when polite language is missing or when syntax rules are broken.
- **Tokenization and Parsing**: Uses custom-built tokenization and parsing to identify keywords, operators, and polite phrases.
- **Code Generation**: Outputs runnable x86 assembly instructions which it will then assemble using the NASM assembler and link object files with the GNU linker to create an executable.
- **Grammar Documentation**: LaTeX/pdf documentation for the grammar of the E++ language, providing production rules and syntax-related information.

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

- A working C/C++ compiler.
- cmake, make

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EthanGilles/epp.git
    ```
2. Enter the repository directory:
    ```bash 
    cd epp
    ```
3. Install the compiler:
    ```bash 
    make install
    ```
4. Test your installation:
    ```bash
    make install-test
    ```

You should get the following output: 
``` 
Hello World!
``` 
Along with two new files in the current directory: `hello.asm` and `hello`.

### Usage

To compile an E++ source code file ending in .epp, use:
```bash 
please file.epp
```


## Example Code 

The following code is an example of a valid 'Hello World!' E++ program:
```
/* Hello world! */
please set H = 72;
please set e to 101;
set l = 108;
set o = 100 + 10 + 2 - 1;
please set space to 8 * 4;
set W to 87;
set r = (50 * 2) + (7 * 2);
set d to 100;
set excl = 3 * 11;

please print(H, e, l, l, o, space, W, o, r, l, d, excl);

goodbye(0);
```

## Grammar Documentation

The full documentation for the grammar is available in `docs/grammar.pdf`
The documentation is created using LaTeX and has the production rules of the grammar. 
An example of the grammar is shown below, with the production rules for statements.

$$
\begin{align*}
  [\text{Prog}] &\to [\text{Statement}]^* \\
  [\text{Statement}] &\to 
  \begin{cases}
    \text{please} \\
    \text{PLEASE} \\
    \text{exit}([\text{Expr}]); \\ 
    \text{set} \; \text{ID} = [\text{Expr}]; \\
    \text{reset} \; \text{ID} = [text{Expr}]; \\
    \text{if} ([\text{Expr}])[\text{Scope}][\text{AfterIf}]  \\
    [\text{Scope}] \\
  \end{cases} \\
\end{align*}
$$
